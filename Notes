Mistakes with current design:
1)  It is better to make the test cases using variables to be able to change it automatically instead of having to change them one per each file. Avoid hard coding.
2)  It is better to make the test cases atomic where they are not relying on other test cases to run first.

============================================================================================================================================================================

1)  We can solve the hard coding issue using the POJO class.
2)  We can use the JSONProperty annotation for names of keys that have "_" and manage the name of the variable to match the naming conventions.
3)  Build a constructor for the POJO classes.
4)  We can use the following annotation in the POJO classes to avoid sending NULL keys in the request: @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)
5)  Boolean variables have a default false value which means it will be sent by the jackson in the request even if you don't want to send it.
    To solve it:     @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT) On the variable level
